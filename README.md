Simple Python program to read in an election result and count how many seats each winning party got.

Plans:
- ability to add custom parties and define custom rules
- ability to import csv files
- ability to visualise results (majorities, swings etc)
- numerical results able to be imported
- reading in multiple results shows changes etc
- analysis in gui

Currently does:
- basic text file input and output of party names (counts them and outputs a 'seat' count)

Will soon do:
- more advanced output, and will accept more than just party name counts (automatically)
